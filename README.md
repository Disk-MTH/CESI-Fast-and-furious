## Fast and Furious, CESI 2023

### Description

This repository is the result of a projet for my engineering school. 
This project is not intended to be modified in the future, 
but I leave it in free access for those who may be interested.

/!\ The code is in english but the Livrable_3.pynb is in French (because I'm French) 

/!\ Some parts may be wrong, contains errors (both in the code and in the equations to be solved), I therefore decline all responsibility in the event of recopying caused by errors, this project is open-source for educational purposes

### Content

The code is used to solve mechanical equations and to simulate the course with different parameters. The code contains the study of an inclined slope, a loop and a jump over a ravine.

You can find all the mechanical studies in the jupyter notebook, and the code in the python file.

### License

All the files in this repository are completely free of rights (see the [license](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/CESI-Fast-and-furious/blob/main/LICENSE)) so you can grab the code and do whatever you want with them (just respect the [license](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/CESI-Fast-and-furious/blob/main/LICENSE)).

Thanks for reading and good development!
